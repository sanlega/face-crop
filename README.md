# FaceCrop 📸

FaceCrop is a simple command-line tool that automates the cropping of images 🖼️ based on face detection. It works by identifying the largest face (i.e., the face that's likely closest to the camera) in an image, adds a margin around it (which you can customize), and then crops the image to this area. This tool is ideal for quickly cropping batches of images for social media 👥, user avatars 🚀, or AI training datasets 💡.

## Dependencies 🛠️

FaceCrop depends on the following Python libraries:

- OpenCV
- PIL
- glob
- argparse
- os

Please make sure these are installed. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install opencv-python Pillow
```

## Usage 💻

This tool can be used through the command line. Here is the general syntax:

```sh
python3 facecrop.py [input_directory] -o [output_directory] -s [desired_size] -r [margin_ratio]
```

Where:
- `[input_directory]` is the path to the directory containing the images you want to crop.
- `[output_directory]` (optional) is the path to the directory where you want to save the cropped images. If not provided, a new folder named "resized" will be created in the input directory.
- `[desired_size]` (optional) is the desired size of the output images in pixels (default is 500).
- `[margin_ratio]` (optional) is the margin around the face as a ratio of the face size (default is 0.2).

For example, the following command will crop all images in the "input_images" folder and save them to the "resized" folder. The size of the output images will be 500x500 pixels, and a 20% margin will be added around each detected face:

```sh
python3 facecrop.py input_images -o cropped_images -s 500 -r 0.2
```

## Notes 📝

- The face detection may not be perfect, especially with low-quality images, unusual lighting conditions, or uncommon face orientations. However, it should work well for typical photos 📷.
- The tool will try to center the eyes and mouth of the face to the center of the image 😊.
- The cropping and resizing process may distort the aspect ratio of the original image.
- Images without any detected faces will not be processed 🚫.
- The tool works with most common image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
